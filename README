This project is for generating and managing 3x3 magic squares that contain
perfect squares.  It uses libgmp (GNU Multiprecision Arithmetic Library)
for arbitrary precision arithmetic on very large integers.

What does the name mean?
The word Fituvalu is a compound word of the words "seven eight" in Samoan.

There are top level programs that we want to run primarily, and then there
are helper programs.  These programs are designed in the UNIX fashion;
they are command-line programs with the output of one program being passed to
the input of another via pipes.

One way to find 3x3 magic squares is to generate progressions of numbers.
There are generally two kinds of progressions that we are searching for:
The "step progression", and the "fulcrum progression".

step progression:
        |-----+--+--+-------+--+--+-------+--+--+------|
               D1       E1
The step progression is defined by two distances.

fulcrum progression:
        |-+--------+--+-----+--+--+-----+--+--------+--|
              D1    E1   F1
The fulcrum progression is defined by three distances, where the first
distance adds up to the sum of the next two distances.

These depict a number line with predefined distances between the numbers.
These progressions can be trivially transformed into 3x3 magic squares.


Common Options
--------------

--in-binary
--out-binary

When using arbitrary precision integers it is faster to deal with their raw
formats.  Many of these programs have an option for reading or writing the
raw GMP formats rather than textual representations of numbers.
When reading and writing billions of records, the time savings can be
considerable.

--increment=NUM
Many of these programs iterate over perfect squares.  Instead of iterating
to the next square, we can go NUM squares forward using this option.


Top-level Programs
------------------


step-progression and fulcrum-progression programs iterate through squares to
find 3x3 magic squares that have at least 5 perfect squares.

program: step-progression-1
Usage: step-progression-1 [--squares=FILE] [--in-binary] [--out-binary] [--increment=NUM] MIN MAX

Here are the perfect squares we're searching for in this program:
|-----+--+--+-------+--+--+-------+--+--+------|
      ^  ^  ^       ^                           
      1  2  3       4                           

All of the progression programs will provide a visual depiction of the
squares they're searching for in their --help.  The --squares option causes
the program to take the starting perfect square from the standard input so
you can have more control over what progressions get generated.

You run it like this:
$ step-progression-1 1 1000 | head -n1
1, 25, 49, 121, 145, 169, 241, 265, 289

program: morgenstern-search-type-1
Usage: morgenstern-search-type-1 [--filter=NUM] [--out-binary] MAX
 or:   morgenstern-search-type-1 [--filter=NUM] [--out-binary] [--mem] FILE

Whereas the prior programs generate 3x3 magic squares with 4 perfect
squares and then hope that a 5th, 6th, or 7th perfect square shows up, the
morgenstern-search programs generate 3x3 magic squares with 5 perfect squares
and then hope that a 6th or 7th perfect square shows up.

The approach is create two arithmetic progressions of 3 perfect squares with
a single square in common.  The results are much larger, and less varied in
terms of magic square types.

The standard input provides the parametric "MN" values -- two values per record
to assist in the transformation.  The seq-morgenstern-mn program provides
these numbers.

If you pass in a number "MAX", it will automatically iterate up to MAX against
each of the records passed in on the standard input.  If you pass in a FILE,
it will iterate each of the records in FILE against each of the records passed
in on the standard input.  This method is slightly faster because there's no
calculation involved.

The --filter=NUM option displays magic squares that have NUM or more perfect squares.  The --mem option reads FILE and the standard input into memory, instead of rewinding and re-reading data on disk.  When the FILE and the standard input are identical, the --mem option avoids the generation of duplicate magic squares.

Morgenstern type 1 squares have 5 perfect squares in this configuration:
+-------+-------+-------+
|  A^2  |       |  C^2  |
+-------+-------+-------+
|       |  E^2  |       |
+-------+-------+-------+
|  G^2  |       |  I^2  |
+-------+-------+-------+

In this case, A^2, E^2, I^2 is one arithmetic progression of three perfect
squares, and C^2, E^2, G^2 is the other.  They share E^2 in common.

program: 3sq-pair-search
Usage: 3sq-pair-search [--in-binary] [--out-binary] N1, N2, N3,
  or:  3sq-pair-search [OPTION...] FILE

The idea here is to make 3x3 magic squares from two arithmetic progressions
of three perfect squares.  The progressions require a single number in common;
either the first number (the lowest number) or the center number.  When they
don't have a number in common, this program tries to scale the progressions
forward so they do.

These progressions are generated by running "find-3sq-progressions",
"find-3sq-progressions-mn", "find-3sq-progressions-gutierrez",
"find-3sq-progressions-dist", and "mine-3sq-progressions".

This program accepts a progression on the standard input, and check it against
a set of progressions by passing in FILE.  Alternatively we can check it
against a single progression by passing in N1..N3 as arguments on the
command-line.


program: scissor-square
Usage: scissor-square [--in-binary] [--out-binary] N1, N2, N3,
  or:  scissor-square [--in-binary] [--out-binary] FILE

Try to create a 3x3 of magic square from two progressions of three squares that
have the same difference between the squares, or the differences must be
divisible.  This program tries create a magic square with the following layouts:
+------+------+------+     +------+------+------+
|      |  X3  |  N2  |     |  X2  |      |  N3  |
+------+------+------+     +------+------+------+
|  N3  |      |  X1  | and |      |  N2  |  X1  |
+------+------+------+     +------+------+------+
|  X2  |  N1  |      |     |  N1  |  X3  |      |
+------+------+------+     +------+------+------+


The first progression is given as the arguments N1, N2, N3.  The second progression is
passed in on the standard input.  Alternatively you can try the progressions on the
standard input with a set of progressions by passing in FILE.

The three values must be perfect squares, separated by a comma and terminated
by a newline, and must be in ascending order.  This program also generates 3x3
nearly-magic squares. 


Helper Programs
---------------


program: permute-square 
Usage: permute-square [--display-offset] [--show-all]

Try all permutations of a given progression on the standard input
until it becomes a magic square.  With the --display-offset option, this
program generates transformations for use in the "transform-square"
program.  With the --show-all option, this command will show all possible
permutations of the square.

program: auto-transform-square
Usage: auto-transform-square [-n]

Like "permute-square" but much faster because it uses "transform-square".
It takes the transformations in the first 100 squares and uses them to
transform the rest.  The 100 can be changed with the -n option.

program: transform-square
Usage: transform-square [OPTION...] TRANSFORM-FILE

Transform a set of progressions into magic squares given a data file of
transformations.  When a progression can't be transformed it is displayed
on the standard error.

program: count-squares
Usage: count-squares [--filter=NUM-SQUARES]

Count how many perfect squares a magic square has, or filter squares that
only have a given number of squares using the --filter option.

program: reduce-square
Usage: reduce-square [OPTION...]

Determine what the lowest value is for the given magic square and have it
still retain all of the perfect squares.

program: rotate-square
Usage: rotate-square [OPTION...]

Given a magic square, show the rotations and reflections of it.

program: uniq-squares
Usage: uniq-squares [OPTION...]

Given a set of magic squares, only show the unique ones.
E.g. take into account all rotations, reflections and reductions.

program: type-square
Usage: type-square [--filter=NUM_SQUARES:TYPE] [---no-show-squares]

Given a magic square determine which of the configurations it is.  Using the
--filter option, this program filters a given set of magic squares such that
 they only have the given type.  It displays records of the form: "5:12"
(e.g. this magic square has 5 perfect squares, laid out in type 12.)

program: sort-square
Usage: sort-square [--prefix=NAME]

Given a magic square, put it in a file called fives, sixes, sevens etc.
according to how many perfect squares it contains.

program: odd-square
Usage: odd-square [--even] [--mixed] [--doubly-even]

Given a magic square, show it if it's comprised of odd numbers.
The --even option shows even instead of odd, --doubly-even shows the squares
where all the numbers are divisible by 4, and --mixed has both odd numbers
and even numbers.

program: number-square
Usage: number-square [--min] [--max]

Given a 3x3 magic square on the standard input, output the magic number.  Only
do so if the square is a magic square.
Use --min and --max to display the smallest and largest values in the square.

program: check-square
Usage: check-square [OPTION...]

Given a set of 9 numbers on the standard input, check if it's a magic square.
Only display it if it is.

program: lucas-square
Usage: lucas-square [--show-abc] [--in-binary] [--out-binary] [--inverse] [--from-abc]

Given a 3x3 magic square on the standard input, only show it if it is in the
Lucas family of squares.  The Lucas family has the following structure:
+-------------+-------------+-------------+
|    c - b    | c + (a + b) |    c - a    |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| c - (a - b) |      c      | c + (a - b) |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+
|    c + a    | c - (a + b) |    c + b    |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+

The --inverse option only shows squares that aren't in the Lucas family.
The --show-abc option displays the a, b, and c values that generate the
magic square.  The --from-abc option takes in a, b, and c values from the
standard input and generates a 3x3 magic square.

program: progression-type-square
Usage: progression-type-square [--filter=TYPE] [--show-def]

Given a magic square on the standard input, determine which of the two
progression types it is.  1 is to "step progression", and 2 is
"fulcrum progression".  Using the --filter option, this program filters magic
squares based on progression type.  The --show-def option shows the distances
between the numbers.  For "step progression" squares, it shows 2 distances,
and for "fulcrum progression" squares" it shows 3 distances.

program: display-square
Usage: display-square [--number-line] [--no-magic-number] [--show-sums] [--simple]

Pretty-print a 3x3 square and put the values inside the cells.  This program
will also display the sums of the rows and columns and diagonals when the
square is not magic.

program: sq-seq [--out-binary]
Usage: sq-seq [OPTION...] FIRST
  or:  sq-seq [OPTION...] FIRST LAST
  or:  sq-seq [OPTION...] FIRST INCREMENT LAST

Generate a sequence of perfect squares.  This program works like "seq" from
GNU Coreutils, but loops over squares.  It can be given an increment to 
loop over every Nth square in the sequence.

program: 4sq
Usage: 4sq [--filter=NUM] [--type=NAME] [--in-binary] [--out-binary] [--increment=NUM] START FINISH
  or:  4sq [--filter=NUM] [--type=NAME] [--in-binary] [--out-binary] [--increment=NUM] FINISH

Generate a progression of 4 perfect squares.  4 squares in an arithmetic
progression is impossible (e.g. where the distance between them is the
same), but if the distance between one or more of the squares is varied,
it can still form the basis of a 3x3 magic square.  4sq has four different
strategies for generating 4 square progressions which is controlled by the
--type option.  It can iterate over squares between a START and a FINISH,
or it can take the starting squares from the standard input.

program: complete-4sq-progression
Usage: complete-4sq-progression [--filter=NUM] [--type=NAME] [--in-binary] [--out-binary]

Generate a nine number progression based on four squares from the standard
input, based on a progression strategy defined by the --type option.  There
are 7 of them.  The --filter=NUM option only shows progressions with NUM
squares or more.  The idea is that it accepts input from the "4sq" program.

program: gen-progression
Usage: gen-progression [--filter=NUM] [--type=NAME] [--in-binary] [--out-binary] [--increment=NUM] START FINISH
  or:  gen-progression [--filter=NUM] [--type=NAME] [--in-binary] [--out-binary] [--increment=NUM] FINISH

Generate a progression of 9 numbers that have at least 4 perfect squares.
It can iterate over squares between a START and a FINISH, or it can take the
starting squares from the standard input.  This progression can be easily
transformed into a 3x3 magic square using the "auto-transform-square" command.
The --filter=NUM option only shows progressions with NUM squares or more.

This program is equivalent to using "4sq" and piping it into
"complete-4sq-progression".  It's faster because it's not importing/exporting
numbers to and from strings, and it doesn't involve a pipe.

The following are equivalent:
$ step-progression-1 1 50000  >/tmp/dump1
$ gen_progression --type=step-progression-1 --filter 5 1 50000  >/tmp/dump2
$ diff /tmp/dump1 /tmp/dump2
$

program: seq-morgenstern-mn
Usage: seq-morgenstern-mn MAX

Generates a sequence of numbers that has the form:
M > N > 0, where M and N are coprime, and with one being even and the other one
odd.  The output of this program is suitable for input into the
"morgenstern-search-" programs, as well as the "3sq" program.

program: mine-3sq-progressions
Usage: mine-3sq-progressions [--show-diff] [--in-binary] [--show-root] [--show-sum]

Accept 3x3 magic squares on the standard input and output any arithmetic
progressions that are formed by three perfect squares.  The idea here is that
we are "mining" the results of our previously generated magic squares for
progressions that can be used to make new magic squares.  This program
generates useful input for "3sq-pair-search".

program: find-3sq-progressions
Usage: find-3sq-progressions [--in-binary] [--increment=NUM] [--no-root] [--out-binary] NUM

Given a perfect square on the standard input, generate three equidistant
perfect squares.  NUM is how many times we advance the second square
forward, take the diff and check if the third number is a square or not.
"sq-seq" generates squares for this program to use.  This program generates
useful input for "complete-3sq-progression", and "3sq-pair-search".

program: find-3sq-progressions-mn
Usage: find-3sq-progressions-mn [--in-binary] [--no-root] [--out-binary]

Given a pair of "MN" parametric values on the standard input, generate three
equidistant perfect squares.  It generates records of four numbers separated
by commas, with the final number being the square root of the third square.
This program generates useful input for "complete-3sq-progression", and
"3sq-pair-search".

program: find-3sq-progressions-gutierrez
Usage: find-3sq-progressions-gutierrez [--show-diff] [--in-binary] [--no-root] [--out-binary] MAX [B [C [E]]]

An implementation of an algorithm described by Eddie N. Gutierrez on
www.oddwheel.com, for generating progressions of perfect squares.  These
progressions are suitable for the diagonal line of a 3x3 magic square, as seen
in Andrew Bremner's magic square of 7 squares.  It seems that B and C are
always prime numbers, and E is always even, but that's all I know.   MAX is
how many times the program will iterate its sequence of numbers forward.

This is one of the few programs in this suite of tools that takes negative
numbers as arguments on the command-line.  You will need to put "--" before
a negative number, to signal to the program that your negative numbers
are not command-line options.
For example:

$ find-3sq-progressions-gutierrez -n -- 4 1 -3
4, 4, 4,
1, 1, 1,
4, 4, 4,
49, 25, 1,

Here are the values I've tested:
  MAX   B   C  E
  --- --- --- --
  100   1  -3  2
  100   1 -13 14
  100   1 -17  6
  100   1 -19 10
  100   1 -79 20
  100   1   3  2
  100   1  11 10
  100   1  17  4
  100   1  19  6
  100   1  57 28
  100  -3   1  4
  100  -7   1  8
  100 -15   1  8
  100 -17   1 18
  100   3   1  2
  100   9   1  4
  100  33   1  8
  100  65   1 16

program: find-3sq-progressions-dist
Usage: find-3sq-progressions-dist [--show-diff] [--in-binary] [--no-root] [--out-binary] [--show-sum] [--start=NUM] [--tries=NUM] [--range=NUM] [--no-second] [--no-third] [DISTANCE]

Generate arithmetic progressions of three squares, that are DISTANCE apart.  If
DISTANCE is not provided as an argument, it is read from the standard input.
By default this program checks 5 million squares for a progression with the
given distance.  It searches every perfect square starting at 1, for two other
perfect squares DISTANCE apart.

The --range=NUM options stops the program from checking when we get NUM away
from the starting point.

The --no-second and --no-third options generate progressions where the 2nd
or 3rd numbers are not perfect squares.

program: complete-3sq-progression
Usage: complete-3sq-progression NUM [--increment=NUM]

Given an arithmetic progression of three perfect squares and the root of the
third square on the standard input, generate a progression of four squares.
The fourth square iterated forward NUM times.  This program generates useful
input for "complete-4sq-progression".

program: convert-binary-gmp-records-to-text
Usage: convert-binary-gmp-records-to-text [--num-columns=NUM] [--inverse]

The progression programs have an option to dump records in raw format 
(--out-binary), so we don't spend time converting the numbers to their
textual representation.  This program converts them from the GMP raw format
to that textual representation.  It reads from the standard-input and
outputs the records on the standard output.
The --inverse option converts from text to binary.

How do you use all this?
------------------------


You do something like:
$ step-progression-1 1 36893488147419103232 > data &
(The big number is 2^65.  It's okay that it's not a perfect square.)

Then while it's running you can check it by doing this:

$ cat data | auto-transform-square | type-square | sort | uniq -c
   1565 5:12
   1667 5:21
      4 5:8
      6 5:9
      2 6:14

(e.g. Take the progressions, turn them into magic squares, show the type of
square along with the number of squares it has, sort them, and then count
them all up.)

We can see there are two six-square magic squares with configuration type 14.
But are they the same, or is it a duplicate?

$ cat data | auto-transform-square | count-squares -f 6 | uniq-squares | type-square | sort | uniq -c
      1 6:14
Ah we can see there's only one unique six found.

(e.g. Take the progressions, turn them into magic squares, filter out all
but the six square magic squares, throw away the duplicate squares, show
the type of square along with the number of squares it has, sort them, and
then count them all up.)


Did you find a seven?  You can look at it like this:
$ cat data | auto-transform-square | count-squares -f7 | uniq-squares | display-square 
+--------+--------+--------+
|  373^2 |  289^2 | 565^2  |
+--------+--------+--------+
| 360721 |  425^2 |  23^2  |    magic number = 541875
+--------+--------+--------+
|  205^2 | 527^2  | 222121 |
+--------+--------+--------+

Do you want to take a look at a particular types of square?
$ cat data | auto-transform-square | type-square -f 5:8 -f 5:9 | uniq-squares | wc -l
100
(e.g. Pull the magic squares that have 5 perfect squares, and are in
configurations 8 and 9.  Get rid of the duplicates and count up the uniques
ones.)

How about those morgenstern programs?

$ seq-morgenstern-mn 100 | morgenstern-search-type-8 100  -f 6 | check-square >data

The "morgenstern-search-" programs do not require any transformations -- they
do however, need to be checked for correctness because the algorithm generates
squares with non-distinct values.

How can I mine the magic squares I've already found for other magic squares?

$ cat mysquares | mine-3sq-progressions | uniq > data
$ cat data | sort -g | uniq > data.sorted
$ cat data.sorted | 3sq-pair-search data.sorted > moresquares

Instead of using "mine-3sq-progressions", you can also use:

$ seq-morgenstern-mn 10000 | find-3sq-progressions-mn | uniq > data
or
$ sq-seq 1000000000 | find-3sq-progressions 100000 | uniq > data

Running out of cpu cycles?  Parallelize it with GNU Parallel.

If you have a 32 core system you can do something like this:
$ sq-seq 1 1237940039285380274899124224 | parallel -j32 'echo {} | step-progression-1 --squares=- 1 1237940039285380274899124224' > data

(The big number is 2^90)

With the right configuration, you can even parallelize over remote machines.

$ sq-seq 1 1237940039285380274899124224 | parallel -S 32/: -S 4/192.168.0.1 -S 4/192.168.0.2 'echo {} | step-progression-1 --squares=- 1 1237940039285380274899124224' > data

This does 32 cores locally and 4 remotely at servers 192.168.0.1, and
192.168.0.2.  (ssh must be configured to be able to login without passwords)

This runs the step-progression-1 program once for every line that
"sq-seq 1 1237940039285380274899124224" generates.

A performance increase can be gained by:
1. using binary data files instead of text, and
2. by splitting the input data into equal chunks beforehand; one for
each of our six jobs.  Like so:

$ seq-morgenstern-mn 3500  > /tmp/indata
$ split -d -n l/6 --suffix-length=3 /tmp/indata indata-
$ cat indata-000 | convert-binary-gmp-records-to-text -i -n2 > indata-000.bin
$ cat indata-001 | convert-binary-gmp-records-to-text -i -n2 > indata-001.bin
$ cat indata-002 | convert-binary-gmp-records-to-text -i -n2 > indata-002.bin
$ cat indata-003 | convert-binary-gmp-records-to-text -i -n2 > indata-003.bin
$ cat indata-004 | convert-binary-gmp-records-to-text -i -n2 > indata-004.bin
$ cat indata-005 | convert-binary-gmp-records-to-text -i -n2 > indata-005.bin
$ mv indata-*.bin /tmp/
$ scp /tmp/indata-*.bin 192.168.1.101:/tmp/
$ seq -f "%03g" 0 5 | parallel -S 3/192.168.1.101 -S 3/:  'cat /tmp/indata-{}.bin | morgenstern-search-type-2 3500 -f 6 -i' > data

We generate /tmp/indata, and then the "split" command generates: "indata-000",
"indata-001" and so on.  Next we convert them from text to binary gmp records.
After manually copying the files into place, we run "seq" so that we get one
number for each of our jobs, and it's the same number of the "indata-???.bin"
file it will operate on.

This method avoids the overhead of regularly setting up and tearing down ssh
connections, as well as starting up and tearing down program executions.
It has a drawback of the output data not being flushed to 'data' immediately.

Maybe you've done that already and you want to extend your search.  Here's how!

In this case we'll be extending our search from 3500 to 5000.

$ seq-morgenstern-mn 3500 > /tmp/3500
$ seq-morgenstern-mn 5000 > /tmp/5000
$ diff --new-line-format="" --unchanged-line-format="" /tmp/5000 /tmp/3500 > /tmp/5000.diff

Now /tmp/5000.diff contains the new values we need to search with.  Split and
convert, and you're searching for new magic squares.

Here's another example of parallelization.

$ seq 1 5000000000000000000 25578614457001433088040  |  parallel --tmpdir=. -S 3/:  'find-3sq-progressions-dist --start={} --range=5000000000000000000' 377850167358576840913440 > data

In this case we know there are several three square progressions that have a
delta of 377850167358576840913440.  We got this number by repeatedly
multiplying 3360 by 13.  We use "find-3sq-progressions-dist" to find
progressions with a specific distance, but it would take a long time to find
the answer using only a single core, so we employ parallellization.

"seq" gives us the starting point, which gets passed to the --start option.
On the first core, GNU parallel will run this:
find-3sq-progressions-dist --start=1 --range=5000000000000000000' 377850167358576840913440

And on the second core, it runs this:
find-3sq-progressions-dist --start=5000000000000000001 --range=5000000000000000000' 377850167358576840913440

And so on.  The results get dumped to "data", and we just manually stop when it
gets filled with 3 records.

We picked the ending point of "seq" (25578614457001433088040) by estimating
based on prior runs.  It is the first value of the first progression from the
prior run, multiplied by ten.  Maybe it's too big, or maybe it's too small to
find the progressions we're looking for.  If it's too small, we'll know where
we haven't searched and if it's too big, we can stop it early.

One more example to illustrate where a beginner might go wrong:
$ step-progression-1 1 1000 | head -n1 | display-square 
                    435
+-----+-----+-----+
| 1^2 | 5^2 | 7^2 | 75
+-----+-----+-----+
| 11^2| 145 | 13^2| 435
+-----+-----+-----+
| 241 | 265 | 17^2| 795
+-----+-----+-----+
  363   435   507   435

"step-progression" does not output magic squares!  They have to passed
through the "auto-transform-square" program.  Also, "display-square" will
show the row and column sums when the square isn't a magic square.

$ step-progression-1 1 1000 | head -n1 | auto-transform-square | display-square 
+----+----+----+
| 5^2| 241|13^2|
+----+----+----+
|17^2| 145| 1^2|        magic number = 435
+----+----+----+
|11^2| 7^2| 265|
+----+----+----+

How do I build these programs?

You'll need a GNU/Linux system, with the normal sort of tools installed:
GNU Bash, GNU GCC, GNU make, GNU automake, GNU autoconf, GNU libtool,
and GNU Coreutils.

Also install libgmp (GNU Multiprecision Arithmetic Library.)

All of these packages are available for installation in the package
management system of your GNU/Linux distribution.

If you are using Fedora you would type something like this:
$ dnf install automake autoconf make gcc libtool gmp-devel
(Bash and Coreutils are already installed by default)

$ git clone http://gitlab.com/
$ cd fituvalu
$ ./configure
$ make
$ su -c 'make install'
